developIdeas.header=Developing ideas
developIdeas.para1.text=Do you have an idea for solving a challenge published on the SOCRATIC platform? Do you wish to further develop this idea in a team? SOCRATIC helps you!
developIdeas.para2.text=Do you have feedback to ideas proposed by other SOCRATIC users? Become a contributor by adding comments to the proposed ideas.
developIdeas.para3.text=The second step in a social innovation process is to generate ideas to solve a social challenge. Several ideas can be proposed. Work together with other people in order to refine one or several ideas. May be the idea you propose or like is not a good idea after all? May be it is and it can get even better. All ideas benefit from the different perspectives from other people. After ideas have been refined, one or a few ones will be selected for the next step, i.e. developing a prototype solution.
developIdeas.point1.text=What is the idea about? Try to formulate in simple terms. How does it help to solve the challenge? What can be the impact of adopting a solution based on the idea? Why should it be selected?
developIdeas.point2.text=How do the beneficiaries perceive the idea? Include beneficiaries or representatives of the beneficiaries in the loop. As problem owners, they know well what is well suited to solve their problems. Let them tell what they like and what can get better. Let them enrich the idea.
developIdeas.point3.text=What expertise is needed to implement the idea? Invite people with the right expertise. The earlier they get involved, the more they will feel ownership in the initiative and  the more they will get engaged in developing solutions.
developIdeas.point4.text=Other experts and friends that can help you to refine or promote the idea? Engage the SOCRATIC community and include other people with different backgrounds to join the discussion. The more people involved, the more potential co-solvers in the next step of the innovation process!
platformProvides.text=The SOCRATIC platform provides:
platformProvides.point1.text=A template for describing the idea. The template helps you to develop the idea and present it in a precise manner. It covers important aspects that you should consider early in the innovation process. It is not only about the idea, but also about the feasibility to implement it and to bring it forward. For example, what resources are needed to implement the idea? When you first create an idea, the template is made available. You can revise and enhance the idea at any time during the discussion.
platformProvides.point2.text=Support for sharing the idea with other people, thus increasing awareness about the idea.
platformProvides.point3.text=Support for inviting contributors in a discussion with the aim to refine the idea together. Contributors can comment. You can revise the idea based on the feedback.
platformProvides.point4.text=Support for contributing to the ideas defined by other members in the SOCRATIC community.
platformProvides.point5.text=Support for liking or following ideas providing a measure of the reception of the idea among the SOCRATIC community and/or interest in implementing it.
platformProvides.para1.text=After the ideas proposed for a challenge have been refined, the best idea or ideas is/are selected for the next step. The challenge definition explains the criteria for selecting an idea.
SOCRATICRecommends.text=SOCRATIC recommends:
SOCRATICRecommends.point1.text=Consider business aspects early. Identify relevant stakeholders, the main values of your solution for them, the approach to reach customers. The earlier you work on it, the more chance you have succeed in deploying the solution based in a real context. The idea template covers some business aspects. All this can refined later when you get more experience from developing and testing a prototype.
SOCRATICRecommends.point2.text=Different tools can be used for different purposes during idea generation and refinement. Have a look at the tools below and chose the one(s) you feel more comfortable with.
tools.header=Tools
tools.text=Present your idea
tools.evevatorPitch.header=Elevator pitch:
tools.evevatorPitch.para1.text=A good way to make your idea clear is to present it to somebody else. Focus on the core of your idea and highlight the value of the idea. How can you catch the attention of your auditor? How can you make your auditor remember the idea? Make your elevator pitch!
tools.evevatorPitch.para2.text=Why \u201Celevator pitch\u201D? It should be possible to present the idea in the time span of an elevator ride. Approximately thirty seconds to two minutes. If you manage to capture attention inside the elevator, then the auditor will go on discussing the idea with you after the ride.
refineIdea.header=Let the beneficiaries help you to refine your idea
refineIdea.text=Some of the tools used when defining a challenge can be also applied:
refineIdea.shadowing.header=Shadowing:
refineIdea.shadowing.text=About understanding the context of the beneficiaries in order to develop relevant ideas.
refineIdea.interviews.header=Interviews:
refineIdea.interviews.text=Can be used for the same purpose as shadowing. In addition, about understanding how the implementation of an idea can fit in the context of the beneficiaries.
questionnaires.header=Questionnaires:
questionnaires.text=While interviews provide deep insights for few persons, questionnaires allow to get feedback from a large number of persons. Questionnaires are useful for gathering opinions from many people, but it is difficult to provide an explanation for the responses. Interviews complement well questionnaires. Questionnaires show a trend, while interviews seek to explain.
questionnaires.immersion.header=Prepare your immersion:
questionnaires.immersion.text=Which information do you want to gather? Who are your respondents? Are they representatives of the beneficiaries you wish to solve a challenge for?
questionnaires.questions.header=Define the questions:
questionnaires.questions.text=Questions should be clear, precise and easy-to-understand. Test your questions with a few persons before sending the questionnaire to your respondents.
questionnaires.results.header=Analyse the results:
questionnaires.results.text=Analyse the answers, question by question. Summarize the answers given by each beneficiaries to all of them. Which are the common answers? Which are divergent? Are these differences due to differences in age, gender, location or any other factor?  Once all the information has been analysed, synthesize the results. Use this as insight for the development of a useful idea.
bringingIdeaForward.header=Bringing the idea forward
bringingIdeaForward.stakeholder.header=Stakeholder map:
bringingIdeaForward.stakeholder.text=Think of all actors that are affected by your idea: your stakeholders. Think beyond the direct beneficiaries. Who has interest of the idea being successful, or unsuccessful?  Who can contribute to it? Who will have power or influence on it?
stakeholder.identify.header=Identify your stakeholders:
stakeholder.identify.text=Think about the context of the main beneficiaries for your idea. Which other actors are involved in their daily life in relation to the social need you wish to address? What about the family, public or private institutions, neighbours, politicians? What is their role? How does your idea fit their needs?  Look at the context with eyes wide open!
stakeholder.organize.header=Organize your stakeholders:
stakeholder.organize.text=Some may benefit from the idea, but have not much influence. Some can contribute and also have influence. How should you involve them for bringing forward your idea? Place them of the Power/Interest grid and define a strategy adapted to their power and interest. Focus on engaging interested stakeholders with power, but do not forget to keep all people with power satisfied, and all interested people informed.
stakeholder.identifyRelations.header=Identify the relations between the stakeholders:
stakeholder.identifyRelations.text=How can you exploit these relations? Can you piggyback on existing collaborations? Should you establish new collaborations? What form of collaboration is useful?
businessModelCanvas.header=Business Model Canvas:
businessModelCanvas.para1.text=The successful implementation of an idea depends on understanding the business context and exploiting business opportunities. The business model canvas is a template for organizing different business elements, such as customers, value propositions, key partners and finances. You can probably not provide all information as once, but is good to start early and to refine the model iteratively as the idea and solution get mature. You can start making a first draft, but later on you should work together with your stakeholders to refine the model.
businessModelCanvas.para2.text=Start thinking about your potential key partners and the key activities needed to develop your idea. Who are your potential customers? Think beyond the beneficiaries. Who may buy the products you are developing? For example, any public or private service institution?  What is the value that you create for the main beneficiaries and other stakeholders that can benefit from your idea? How can you guarantee funds to operate and thrive? What are your competitors and suppliers?
businessModelCanvas.para3.text=Download the business model canvas from
discussingIdea.header=Discussing the idea
discussingIdea.para.text=SOCRATIC provides support for discussing ideas through comments. In addition, you can make use of collaborative documentation tools such as Google Docs and PiratePad. You can also use platforms for virtual meetings and webinars, such as Google Hangouts, Skype and Appear.in. The distance is not be a problem, it is an opportunity to gather many people!
